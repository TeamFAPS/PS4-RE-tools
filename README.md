What is this?

This toolkit provides tools that aid in the development of PS4 homebrews and plugins, as well as PC tools and even emulators, by providing tools that speed up development through automation of processes and gives a more friendly view into complex things of PS4 OS.

These tools heavily contribute to Wiki and open source SDK improvements.
